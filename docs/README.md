# Cost Analysis Documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the cost analysis models and calculations used in the application.

## Structure

- `definitions.tex`: Contains formal mathematical definitions and formulas for all cost models
- `models.md`: Detailed explanation of each cost model, including parameters and break-even analysis
- Additional documentation files provide supplementary information about specific aspects of the analysis

## Cost Models

The application implements three main cost models:

1. Team-based Model
   - Based on team size and composition
   - Includes base pay and overhead costs
   - Considers work distribution between platform and vendor teams

2. Ticket-based Model
   - Based on ticket volume and complexity
   - Includes base cost per ticket
   - Accounts for different ticket types and processing times

3. Solution Models
   - Platform Solution: Custom automation with efficiency improvements
     - Includes build time and maintenance costs
     - Considers team reduction and process efficiency factors
   - Hybrid Solution: Combination of internal and vendor resources
     - Optimizes work distribution
     - Includes transition costs
   - Outsourcing Solution: Full vendor delegation
     - Considers vendor rates and transition costs

## Break-even Analysis

The application calculates break-even periods for each solution:
- Considers initial investment and monthly cost savings
- Includes build time for platform solutions
- Maximum viable period is 24 months
- Handles cases where break-even is not achievable

## Usage

The web application provides an interactive interface to:
- Input current team or ticket-based costs
- Configure solution parameters
- View cost comparisons and break-even analysis
- Explore different scenarios and optimizations

For detailed formulas and calculations, refer to `definitions.tex` and `models.md`.
