# Business Impact Bias Assessment Model

## Overview
This model aims to reduce subjective bias in assessing a solution's business impact by cross-referencing internal perception with market indicators and industry standards.

## Assessment Framework

### 1. Internal Assessment
Initial assessment based on internal perception:
- Revenue Critical: Directly impacts core business, customer experience, or revenue generation
- Business Enabling: Enhances key operations, improves team efficiency, or reduces significant costs
- Internal Supporting: Helps with back-office operations, administrative tasks, or internal processes

### 2. Market Validation Factors

#### 2.1 Competitor Analysis
Compare internal assessment with competitor approaches:

| Internal Assessment | Competitor Approach | Bias Indicator |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Revenue Critical  | Core Business       | Low Bias       |
| Revenue Critical  | Supporting          | High Bias      |
| Business Enabling | Core Business       | Under-valued   |
| Business Enabling | Supporting          | Over-valued    |
| Supporting        | Core Business       | Severe Under-valued |
| Supporting        | Business Enabling   | Under-valued   |

#### 2.2 Market Evolution Indicators
Use market evolution pace to validate assessment:

| Evolution Pace | Standardization | Impact on Assessment |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Fast          | Low            | Likely Critical/Strategic |
| Fast          | High           | Likely Commodity/Supporting |
| Moderate      | Low            | Potential Differentiator |
| Moderate      | High           | Business Enabling |
| Slow          | Low            | Niche/Specialized |
| Slow          | High           | Standard Supporting |

### 3. Bias Correction Model

#### 3.1 Initial Bias Score
Calculate initial bias score (0-100):
- Match with competitors: 0-40 points
- Market evolution alignment: 0-30 points
- Standardization alignment: 0-30 points

#### 3.2 Adjustment Triggers

| Bias Score | Action Required |
|------------|----------------|
| 0-20       | No adjustment needed |
| 21-40      | Minor adjustment (±1 level) |
| 41-60      | Moderate adjustment (±1-2 levels) |
| 61-80      | Major adjustment (±2 levels) |
| 81-100     | Complete reassessment needed |

### 4. Decision Matrix

#### 4.1 Primary Factors
- Competitor Alignment (CA)
- Market Evolution (ME)
- Standardization Level (SL)

#### 4.2 Assessment Rules

```typescript
function adjustBusinessImpact(
  internalAssessment: 'critical' | 'enabling' | 'supporting',
  competitorApproach: 'core' | 'enabling' | 'supporting',
  marketEvolution: 'fast' | 'moderate' | 'slow',
  standardization: 'high' | 'moderate' | 'low'
): {
  adjustedAssessment: string;
  confidenceLevel: number;
  biasScore: number;
}
```

#### 4.3 Confidence Calculation
Confidence in assessment (0-100):
- High match (80-100): All indicators align
- Medium match (60-79): Most indicators align
- Low match (0-59): Significant discrepancies

### 5. Implementation Guidelines

1. **Gather Market Data**
   - Research minimum 3 direct competitors
   - Analyze industry reports/trends
   - Review technology adoption patterns

2. **Apply Bias Detection**
   - Compare internal vs market perception
   - Identify discrepancies in assessment
   - Calculate bias score

3. **Make Adjustments**
   - Apply correction model
   - Document justification
   - Update assessment if needed

4. **Monitor and Validate**
   - Track assessment accuracy over time
   - Gather feedback from stakeholders
   - Refine model based on outcomes

### 6. Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: High Bias Risk
- Internal: Revenue Critical
- Competitors: Supporting Function
- Market: Slow Evolution, High Standardization
- Action: Likely downgrade to Business Enabling

#### Scenario 2: Low Bias Risk
- Internal: Business Enabling
- Competitors: Similar Approach
- Market: Moderate Evolution, Moderate Standardization
- Action: Maintain Assessment

#### Scenario 3: Under-valued Risk
- Internal: Supporting
- Competitors: Core Business
- Market: Fast Evolution, Low Standardization
- Action: Consider upgrade to Revenue Critical

## Usage in Build vs Buy Decision

### Impact on Decision Weights
- High Bias Score (>60): Reduce weight of business impact in final decision
- Low Bias Score (<30): Maintain original weight
- Medium Bias Score (30-60): Apply proportional adjustment

### Confidence Level Effect
- Adjust recommendation confidence based on bias assessment
- Include bias analysis in final report
- Flag high-bias cases for additional review

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Review Cycle
- Quarterly review of market indicators
- Annual model validation
- Continuous collection of outcome data

### Model Refinement
- Update weights based on historical accuracy
- Add new market indicators as needed
- Refine adjustment triggers based on feedback

## Integration with Existing Framework

### Data Collection
1. Add competitor analysis section
2. Enhance market evolution questions
3. Include standardization assessment

### Visualization
1. Show bias indicators in results
2. Include confidence adjustments
3. Provide bias-adjusted recommendations

### Documentation
1. Document all bias adjustments
2. Explain confidence calculations
3. Provide justification for changes
