## 2. Team-Based Model

### 2.1 Base Analysis

#### Core Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Base Monthly Cost | `Team Size × Hourly Rate × 160 × Service Efficiency × (1 + Overhead)` | Total monthly operational cost |
| Annual Cost | `Monthly Cost × 12` | Yearly operational expense |
| Team Efficiency | `Productive Hours ÷ Total Hours × 100` | Team productivity percentage |
| Cost per Resource | `Monthly Cost ÷ Team Size` | Average cost per team member |

#### 2.1.1 Platform Solution

**Input Parameters**
| Parameter | Type | Range | Description |
|-----------|------|-------|-------------|
| Platform Cost | Currency | $50k-$10M | Initial platform investment |
| Build Time | Months | 3-24 | Implementation period |
| Team Reduction | Percentage | 0-75% | Expected team size reduction |
| Process Efficiency | Percentage | 0-75% | Expected efficiency improvement |
| Maintenance Cost | Currency | $1k-$1M/month | Ongoing platform costs |

**Cost Structure**
```
Implementation Cost = Platform Cost + (Current Monthly Cost × Build Time)
Monthly Operating Cost = Reduced Team Cost + Maintenance Cost
where:
Reduced Team Cost = Current Monthly Cost × (1 - Team Reduction) × (1 - Process Efficiency)
```

**ROI Calculations**
```
Monthly Savings = Current Monthly Cost - Monthly Operating Cost
Break Even Months = Implementation Cost ÷ Monthly Savings
Annual ROI = (Monthly Savings × 12 - Implementation Cost) ÷ Implementation Cost × 100
```

**Decision Metrics**
| Metric | Threshold | Decision Impact |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Break Even Period | < 24 months | Project viability |
| Monthly Savings | > 20% of current cost | Solution effectiveness |
| Process Efficiency | > 30% | Automation potential |

#### 2.1.2 Outsource Solution

**Input Parameters**
| Parameter | Type | Range | Description |
|-----------|------|-------|-------------|
| Vendor Rate | Currency | $25-$150/hour | Outsourcing partner rate |
| Transition Time | Months | 1-12 | Knowledge transfer period |
| Management Overhead | Percentage | 10-50% | Additional management cost |
| Quality Impact | Percentage | -20 to +20% | Service quality change |
| Knowledge Loss | Percentage | 0-50% | Expected knowledge degradation |

**Cost Structure**
```
Transition Cost = Current Monthly Cost × Transition Time × 0.5
Base Vendor Cost = Monthly Hours × Vendor Rate
Overhead Cost = Base Vendor Cost × Management Overhead
Quality Adjustment = Base Vendor Cost × |Quality Impact|
Knowledge Factor = 1 + (Knowledge Loss × log₁₀(Transition Time + 1))

Total Monthly Cost = (Base Vendor Cost + Overhead Cost) × Quality Adjustment × Knowledge Factor
```

**Efficiency Impact**
```
Service Level Impact = Current SLA × (1 - |Quality Impact|)
Knowledge Retention = 1 - (Knowledge Loss × (1 - e^(-Transition Time)))
```

#### 2.1.3 Hybrid Solution

**Input Parameters**
| Parameter | Type | Range | Description |
|-----------|------|-------|-------------|
| Platform Portion | Percentage | 0-100% | Work handled by platform |
| Vendor Portion | Percentage | 0-100% | Work outsourced |
| Platform Config | - | Same as Platform | Platform parameters |
| Outsource Config | - | Same as Outsource | Outsourcing parameters |

**Cost Structure**
```
Platform Cost Component = Platform Portion × Platform Solution Cost
Vendor Cost Component = Vendor Portion × Outsource Solution Cost
Total Cost = Platform Cost Component + Vendor Cost Component

Monthly Operating Cost = (Platform Monthly Cost × Platform Portion) +
                        (Vendor Monthly Cost × Vendor Portion)
```

**Optimization Formula**
```
Optimal Split = min(Total Cost) where Platform Portion + Vendor Portion = 100%
```

### 2.2 Target Planning

**Input Parameters**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Define Targets] --> B[Calculate Requirements]
    B --> C[Generate Scenarios]
    C --> D[Evaluate Feasibility]
    D --> E[Optimize Parameters]
    E --> F[Generate Implementation Plan]
```

**Calculation Formulas**
```
Required Monthly Savings = Initial Investment × (1 + Target ROI) ÷ Target Timeline
Required Efficiency = 1 - (Target Operating Cost ÷ Current Cost)
Platform Investment Ceiling = Monthly Savings × Target Timeline × (1 - Risk Factor)
```

### 2.3 Team Dependencies

**Analysis Components**
| Component | Metrics | Analysis Method |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Workflow Dependencies | Lead Time, WIP | Critical Path Analysis |
| Knowledge Dependencies | Knowledge Overlap, Bus Factor | Graph Analysis |
| Resource Dependencies | Resource Utilization, Bottlenecks | Capacity Planning |

**Dependency Calculations**
```
Impact Score = Dependency Weight × Frequency × Criticality
Bottleneck Score = Queue Time ÷ Processing Time
Knowledge Risk = 1 - (Knowledge Holders ÷ Team Size)
```

**Optimization Metrics**
```
Process Efficiency = 1 - (Wait Time ÷ Total Time)
Resource Utilization = Active Time ÷ Available Time
Knowledge Distribution = min(Knowledge Holders per Area)
```
