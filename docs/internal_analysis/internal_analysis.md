# Technical Documentation: Internal Analysis & Target-Based Planning

# Part I: Internal Analysis

## Overview

Internal Analysis is designed to help organizations understand and optimize their team interactions, dependencies, and workflow efficiency. This analysis focuses on three key aspects:
1. Team dependencies and their impact
2. Work distribution and flow efficiency
3. Coordination costs and optimization opportunities

## 1. Team Dependency Analysis

### Motivation
Team dependencies in modern organizations can significantly impact productivity, lead times, and costs. Understanding these dependencies helps:
- Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- Optimize team structures and interactions
- Reduce coordination overhead
- Improve delivery predictability

### Key Metrics and Formulations

#### 1.1 Dependency Impact Score (DIS)
```
DIS = Σ(Wi × Di × Ci)

Where:
- Wi = Work item volume between teams i
- Di = Dependency strength (1-5 scale)
- Ci = Coordination cost factor
```

This metric quantifies the overall impact of dependencies by considering:
- Volume of work items exchanged between teams
- Strength/criticality of dependencies
- Associated coordination costs

| Dependency Strength | Description | Example |
|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Minimal | Occasional information sharing |
| 2 | Low | Regular updates needed |
| 3 | Medium | Shared deliverables |
| 4 | High | Critical path dependencies |
| 5 | Critical | Blocking dependencies |

#### 1.2 Flow Efficiency Analysis

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Work Item] --> B[Wait Time]
    B --> C[Process Time]
    C --> D[Wait Time]
    D --> E[Process Time]
    E --> F[Complete]
```

**Flow Efficiency (FE)**
```
FE = (Σ VAT) / (Σ LT) × 100%

Where:
- VAT = Value-added time (actual work)
- LT = Total lead time (including wait times)
```

This metric helps understand:
- Actual value-adding activities vs. wait times
- Process efficiency
- Opportunity areas for improvement

### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|------|-------------|----------|
| Team Size | Integer | Number of team members | 7 |
| Dependencies | Matrix | Team dependency mapping | [See Matrix Below] |
| WIP Limits | Integer | Maximum concurrent work | 5 |
| Throughput | Float | Items completed per time | 3.5/week |

**Dependency Matrix Example:**
```
    T1  T2  T3  T4
T1  -   3   1   0
T2  3   -   2   1
T3  1   2   -   4
T4  0   1   4   -
```

### Output Metrics

#### 1.3 System Performance Indicators

| Metric | Formula | Target Range | Action if Outside Range |
|--------|---------|--------------|------------------------|
| Flow Efficiency | FE = VAT/LT | > 40% | Review handoffs and wait times |
| WIP Impact | WIS = Σ(WIPi/Ti) | < 1.5 | Adjust WIP limits |
| Lead Time | SLT = Σ(LTi × Di/Dmax) | Varies | Analyze bottlenecks |

## 2. Distribution Models

### 2.1 Even Distribution Model

This model optimizes for balanced team dependencies and workload.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Team 1] --- B[Team 2]
    A --- C[Team 3]
    B --- C
    B --- D[Team 4]
    C --- D
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- Equal number of dependencies per team
- Balanced workload distribution
- Minimized coordination overhead

**Dependency Balance Index (DBI)**
```
DBI = σ(Di) / μ(Di)

Target: DBI < 0.3 indicates good balance
```

### 2.2 Uneven Distribution (Hub-and-Spoke)

Optimized for scenarios with natural centralization.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Central Team] --> B[Team 1]
    A --> C[Team 2]
    A --> D[Team 3]
    A --> E[Team 4]
    B --- C
    C --- D
```

**Centrality Impact (CI)**
```
CI = (Dc / Davg) × (Tc / Tavg)

Where:
- Dc = Central team dependencies
- Davg = Average team dependencies
- Tc = Central team throughput
- Tavg = Average team throughput
```

### Cost Analysis

#### Coordination Cost Breakdown

```
Total Cost = Direct Costs + Indirect Costs + Overhead

Where:
- Direct Costs = Meeting costs + Communication time
- Indirect Costs = Context switching + Wait times
- Overhead = Management coordination + Tools
```

**Annual Cost Calculation:**
```
Annual Cost per Team = Base Cost × (1 + Dependency Factor)

Where:
Base Cost = Team Size × Hourly Rate × Annual Hours
Dependency Factor = Number of Dependencies × 0.15
```

# Part II: Target-Based Planning

## Overview

Target-Based Planning helps organizations set realistic improvement goals and create actionable implementation plans based on their service delivery model. The planning approach differs based on whether the organization uses a team-based or ticket-based model.

## 1. Model-Specific Analysis

### 1.1 Team-Based Planning

This model focuses on optimizing team capacity and efficiency.

#### Key Inputs
- Annual labor cost (team size × hourly rate × hours)
- Current team efficiency metrics
  - Service efficiency (%)
  - Operational overhead (%)
- Target savings
- ROI period
- Team capacity metrics
  - Team size
  - Hourly rates
  - Manual work percentage

#### Maximum Allowable Investment (MAI)

```
MAI_team = min(0.5 × AC_team, 1.5 × TS)

Where:
- AC_team = Annual labor cost (team-based)
- TS = Target savings over ROI period
```

#### Efficiency Targets

Required Team Efficiency Gains (RTEG) calculation:

```
RTEG = min(MS / (N × H × W), MC)

Where:
- MS = Monthly savings target
- N = Team size
- H = Hourly rate
- W = Working hours
- MC = Current manual work percentage
```

### 1.2 Ticket-Based Planning

This model focuses on optimizing cost per ticket and volume handling.

#### Key Inputs

#### Maximum Allowable Investment (MAI)

```
MAI_ticket = min(0.5 × AC_ticket, 1.5 × TS)

Where:
- AC_ticket = Annual cost (ticket volume × cost per ticket)
- TS = Target savings over ROI period
```

#### Efficiency Targets

Required Ticket Efficiency Gains (RTEG) calculation:

```
RTEG = min(MS / (M × T × P), PE)

Where:
- MS = Monthly savings target

## Conclusion

This technical documentation provides a comprehensive framework for:
1. Analyzing current state based on delivery model
2. Planning improvements specific to team or ticket approach
3. Monitoring and validating results based on model-specific metrics

The calculations and approaches should be adapted based on:
- Chosen delivery model (team/ticket)
