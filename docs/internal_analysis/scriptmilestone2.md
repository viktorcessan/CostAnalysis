# Presentation Script: Internal Analysis & Target-Based Planning

## Title Slide
"Welcome everyone. Today I'm excited to present our framework for platform development, which combines internal analysis with target-based planning. This innovative approach will help us optimize our migration process while ensuring maximum business value."

## Overview Slide
"Our presentation is structured into two complementary parts:

On the left, we have Part I: Internal Analysis, where we'll examine:
- How teams depend on each other
- How work flows through our organization
- Different distribution models
- Associated costs

On the right, Part II: Target-Based Planning, covering:
- Platform solution options
- Investment considerations
- Different implementation scenarios
- Our optimization strategy"

## Dependency Analysis Framework Slide
"This diagram shows the core relationships in our analysis:
[Point to each arrow as you explain]
- Dependencies affect how efficiently work flows between teams
- They also determine how we should structure our teams
- Flow efficiency directly impacts our costs
- And the scale of our distribution model affects overall costs

This framework helps us understand where to focus our optimization efforts."

## Dependency Impact Score Slide
"We've developed a quantitative way to measure dependencies:
[Point to formula]
- DIS combines three key factors: volume weight (W), dependency strength (D), and cost impact (C)

[Point to color-coded levels]
The levels range from:
- Green: Minimal impact
- Through yellow and orange: Growing concern
- To red: Critical dependencies requiring immediate attention

This scoring helps us prioritize which dependencies to address first."

## Flow Efficiency Model Slide
[Point to timeline visualization]
"Here we see how we measure efficiency:
- Green sections represent value-added time
- Orange section shows wait time
- Our target is to achieve at least 40% efficiency
- This visualization helps identify where delays occur

The formula below shows how we calculate this, helping us track improvements over time."

## Distribution Models Slide
"We've identified two main ways to organize our teams:

[Point to Even Distribution]
Even Distribution model:
- Teams have equal responsibilities
- They communicate directly
- Workload is balanced

[Point to Hub and Spoke]
Hub and Spoke model:
- One central coordinating team
- Streamlined communication flow
- Clear hierarchy for complex projects

Each model has its place depending on the specific needs."

## Cost Structure Slide
[Point to tree diagram]
"Our cost analysis breaks down into:
- Direct Costs: Meetings and communication
- Indirect Costs: Context switching and wait times

[Point to formula]
The total Annual Cost (AC) is calculated using:
- Base Cost (BC)
- Adjusted by our Dependency Factor (DF)
This gives us a complete picture of operational costs."

## Target-Based Approach Slide
[Point to tree diagram]
"Our approach starts with business targets and works backward:
1. Define clear business outcomes
2. Establish measurable metrics
3. Design minimal platform features
4. Implement in iterations

This ensures everything we build directly supports business goals."

## Platform Solutions Slide
"We offer two platform approaches:

[Point to Team-Based Platform]
Team-Based Platform focusing on:
- Team collaboration
- Workflow optimization
- Resource management

[Point to Ticket-Based Platform]
Ticket-Based Platform emphasizing:
- Process efficiency
- Smart routing
- Quality assurance"

## Investment Analysis Slide
[Point to formula]
"Our investment strategy is guided by two key constraints:
- Maximum investment capped at 50% of Annual Cost
- Must deliver at least 150% in Target Savings

This balanced approach ensures ROI while managing risk."

## Scenario Analysis Slide
[Point to timeline]
"We've developed three implementation scenarios:

[Point to each section]
Conservative (Green):
- 10% time reduction
- 15% quality improvement
- 24-month ROI

Moderate (Yellow):
- 20% time reduction
- 25% quality improvement
- 18-month ROI

Aggressive (Red):
- 30% time reduction
- 35% quality improvement
- 12-month ROI"

## Key Takeaways Slide
"Let's summarize the key benefits:

[Left column]
Benefits:
- Data-driven decisions
- Clear metrics
- Risk management
- Adaptable approach

[Right column]
Next Steps:
- Choose platform type
- Set specific targets
- Design minimal solution
- Measure outcomes

We're ready to move forward with whichever approach best fits your needs."

## Closing Notes
- Pause for questions after each major section
- Use laser pointer to highlight specific parts of diagrams
- Keep track of time: aim for 2-3 minutes per slide
- Be ready to dive deeper into any area of particular interest
- Have additional technical details ready if needed
