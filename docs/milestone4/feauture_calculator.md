# Build a Business Case for Specific Features

## TL;DR: Feature Value Calculator
The Feature Value Calculator helps quantify the business impact of a feature by evaluating how it generates revenue, protects revenue, reduces costs, or avoids costs. Users can input relevant data based on their objectives to calculate:

● **Total Value Created**: Annual value from revenue gains or cost reductions  
● **Costs**: Initial development and ongoing maintenance expenses  
● **ROI**: Return on investment based on value versus cost  
● **Break-Even Point**: How long it takes for the feature to pay for itself  

The tool provides:
- Detailed breakdown of value by objective
- ROI and break-even visualization graphs
- Clear results for decision-making and business case development

*Note: Some features combine multiple forms of value making it difficult for managers to quantify the total value.*

## High-Level Conceptual Steps

1. **Identify Objectives**  
   Determine how the feature impacts the business:
   - Generate revenue
   - Protect revenue
   - Reduce costs
   - Avoid costs  
   *(A feature can have multiple objectives)*

2. **Quantify Value**  
   Estimate total annual value per objective:
   - For revenue: Calculate additional revenue generated/protected
   - For costs: Calculate costs saved/avoided

3. **Estimate Costs**  
   Include:
   - Initial development cost
   - Ongoing operational/maintenance costs

4. **Calculate ROI and Break-Even Point**  
   - ROI: Compare value created vs total cost (development + maintenance)
   - Break-Even: Determine when value offsets initial investment

5. **Visualize Results**  
   Present through cumulative value vs. cost graphs over time

## Precise Formulas

### 1. Value Calculation by Objective

**Generate Revenue**  
$$ Total\ Revenue = Revenue\ Per\ Unit × Units\ Sold/Used × Frequency $$
- *Revenue Per Unit*: Revenue per sale/interaction/customer  
- *Units Sold/Used*: Number of sales/interactions  
- *Frequency*: Usage frequency (daily/weekly/monthly)  

**Protect Revenue**  
$$ Revenue\ Protected = (Revenue\ at\ Risk × \frac{Retention\ Improvement\ \%}{100}) $$
- *Revenue at Risk*: Total revenue potentially lost  
- *Retention Improvement*: % retention increase from feature  

**Reduce Costs**  
*Through Time Savings*:  
$$ Cost\ Savings = (\frac{Time\ Saved\ (min)}{60} × Users × Frequency × Hourly\ Rate) $$

*Through Operational Efficiency*:  
$$ Cost\ Savings = (Current\ Cost/Unit × Volume) - (New\ Cost/Unit × Volume) $$

*Through Capacity Reduction*:  
$$ Cost\ Savings = Current\ Utilization\ Cost × \frac{Current\ Utilization\ \% - Expected\ Utilization\ \%}{100} $$

**Avoid Costs**  
*Legal Liability*:  
$$ Avoided\ Costs = Potential\ Legal\ Costs × \frac{Probability\ \%}{100} × \frac{Risk\ Reduction\ \%}{100} $$

*Incident Reduction*:  
$$ Avoided\ Costs = Cost/Incident × Incidents × \frac{Reduction\ \%}{100} $$

*Downtime Reduction*:  
$$ Avoided\ Costs = Downtime\ Reduction\ (hrs) × Cost/Hour × Incidents $$

### 2. Total Annual Value
$$ Total\ Value = Revenue\ Generated + Revenue\ Protected + Costs\ Reduced + Costs\ Avoided $$

### 3. Costs
**Initial Development**  
$$ Initial\ Cost = Hourly\ Rate × Build\ Hours $$

**Ongoing Maintenance**  
$$ Annual\ Maintenance = Monthly\ Cost × 12 $$

### 4. ROI Calculation
$$ ROI\ \% = \frac{Total\ Value - (Initial\ Cost + Annual\ Maintenance)}{Initial\ Cost + Annual\ Maintenance} × 100 $$

### 5. Break-Even Point
$$ Break-Even\ (Months) = \frac{Initial\ Cost}{Monthly\ Value} \quad where \quad Monthly\ Value = \frac{Total\ Value}{12} $$

## Example Calculation

**Feature Impact**:
- Generates $50/interaction × 1,000 users × 12mo = $600,000/year  
- Saves 30min/task × 1k users × $50/hr × 12mo = $300,000/year  
- Avoids 10 incidents/yr × $10k × 20% = $20,000/year  

**Costs**:
- Development: $100/hr × 500hrs = $50,000  
- Maintenance: $2k/mo × 12 = $24,000  

**Calculations**:
$$ Total\ Value = 600,\!000 + 300,\!000 + 20,\!000 = \$920,\!000/yr $$
$$ ROI = \frac{920,\!000 - (50,\!000 + 24,\!000)}{50,\!000 + 24,\!000} × 100 = 1,\!113.5\% $$
$$ Break-Even = \frac{50,\!000}{920,\!000/12} = 0.65\ months $$
