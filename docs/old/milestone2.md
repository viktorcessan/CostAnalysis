Next Milestone Features:

1. Reverse Cost Analysis Calculator
- Target: Engineering managers with limited data points
- Two distinct scenarios:
  a) Complete Data Scenario:
    - Manager knows current costs
    - Knows platform building costs
    - Comfortable making assumptions
    - Gets direct projections (current functionality)
  
  b) Limited Data Scenario:
    - Manager only knows basic team metrics:
      * Team size
      * Hourly costs
      * Rough service/manual work estimates
    - Calculator determines:
      * Maximum allowable platform cost for desired ROI period (e.g. 12/24 months)
      * Required efficiency improvements/manual labor reduction
      * Break-even scenarios based on different assumptions

2. Process Efficiency Analysis
- New module for analyzing internal improvements separate from platform/outsourcing
- Key metrics:
  * Quality improvements value
  * Knowledge retention impact
  * Process standardization benefits
  * Team dependencies analysis
    - Impact of dependencies (5-10 teams)
    - Work in Progress (WIP) effects
    - Lead time calculations using queuing theory
    
3. Four Improvement Modes Framework
- Base (current state baseline)
- Internal Improvements (process efficiency, quality, knowledge)
- Dependencies Improvements (team interactions, WIP, lead time)
- Solution Alternatives:
  * Platform Implementation
  * Outsourcing
  
The overall goal is to expand the tool beyond simple cost comparisons to help managers:
1. Make decisions with incomplete data
2. Understand the value of internal improvements
3. Quantify the impact of team dependencies
4. Compare different improvement approaches holistically

All these features would be integrated into the existing UI without adding complexity to the user experience.
