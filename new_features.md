## Internal Analysis

The Internal Analysis module is designed to quantify and visualize the complex relationships between teams in modern software development organizations. Our modeling approach focuses on three key aspects: dependencies, costs, and distribution patterns.

### Team Dependency Analysis

The foundation of our analysis is the Dependency Impact Score (DIS), which quantifies the "cost of coordination" between teams. This metric was carefully designed to capture both the explicit and implicit costs of team dependencies.

#### Dependency Impact Score (DIS)
```math
DIS = \sum(W_i × D_i × C_i)
```

The formula combines three critical factors:
- Work Volume (W_i): Represents the frequency of interactions
- Dependency Strength (D_i): Captures the criticality of dependencies
- Coordination Cost (C_i): Accounts for the overhead of coordination

This multiplicative relationship was chosen because:
1. Dependencies become more costly as work volume increases
2. Strong dependencies (D_i) amplify coordination costs
3. The impact scales with the complexity of coordination required

#### Dependency Visualization

Team Dependency Network:

     Team A ----3---- Team B
       |  \           |
       2    \2        4
       |      \       |
     Team C     Team D
       \         /
        \1      2
         \    /
          Team E

Legend:
- Numbers indicate dependency strength (1-5)
- Line thickness represents work volume
```

#### Dependency Strength Scale
| Level | Value | Description | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Minimal | 1 | Occasional information sharing | Base level coordination |
| Low | 2 | Regular updates needed | Standard team coupling |
| Medium | 3 | Shared deliverables | Significant coordination required |
| High | 4 | Critical path dependencies | Major impact on delivery |
| Critical | 5 | Blocking dependencies | Maximum coordination cost |

The 1-5 scale was chosen because:
- It provides sufficient granularity without overcomplexity
- Maps well to common Agile/Scrum dependency classifications
- Allows for meaningful differentiation of dependency types

### Cost Analysis

Our cost model breaks down team interaction costs into four categories, each capturing a distinct aspect of coordination overhead. The formulas were designed to reflect real-world cost behaviors observed in software development teams.

#### Cost Categories and Calculations

1. **Meeting Costs**
```math
MonthlyCost = hourlyRate × weeklyHours × attendeesPerTeam × 4.33
```

Design Rationale:
- Linear scaling with team size reflects the true cost of synchronous communication
- 4.33 factor accounts for average month length
- Includes full loaded costs to capture true organizational impact

Cost Behavior Diagram:
```
Meeting Cost Growth:

Cost │    ╱
     │   ╱
     │  ╱
     │ ╱
     │╱
     └─────────────
       Team Size
```

2. **Communication Overhead**
```math
OverheadCost = baseCost × overheadFactor × waitTimeMultiplier
```

Design Rationale:
- Multiplicative factors capture the compounding nature of communication overhead
- Overhead factor range (1.0-2.0) based on Brooks' Law observations
- Wait time multiplier reflects the cost of asynchronous delays

Communication Pattern:
```
Overhead Growth:

Cost │      ╱
     │    ╱
     │  ╱╱
     │╱
     └─────────────
       Dependencies
```

3. **Tools & Support**
```math
MonthlyCost = (perToolCost × tools) + (supportCost × teams)
```

Design Rationale:
- Separates per-tool licensing from per-team infrastructure costs
- Linear scaling reflects typical enterprise licensing models
- Support costs scale with team count due to infrastructure needs

4. **Management & Process**
```math
MonthlyCost = managementCost × teams + (managerRate × processHours)
```

Design Rationale:
- Two-part formula captures both fixed and variable management costs
- Linear scaling with team count reflects span of control limits
- Process hours increase with organizational complexity

### Distribution Models

Our analysis considers two primary team distribution patterns, each with distinct characteristics and trade-offs.

#### Even Distribution Model
```math
DBI = \frac{\sigma(D_i)}{\mu(D_i)}
```

Even Distribution Pattern:
```
   T1 ─── T2 ─── T3
   │      │      │
   T4 ─── T5 ─── T6
   │      │      │
   T7 ─── T8 ─── T9
```

Design Rationale:
- DBI < 0.3 target based on empirical studies of successful team structures
- Standard deviation to mean ratio captures distribution uniformity
- Lower scores indicate more maintainable team structures

#### Hub-and-Spoke Model
```math
CI = \left(\frac{D_c}{D_{avg}}\right) × \left(\frac{T_c}{T_{avg}}\right)
```

Hub-and-Spoke Pattern:
```
       T2
       │
   T1 ─┼─ T3
       │
   T4 ─┼─ T5
       │
       T6
```

Design Rationale:
- Centrality Impact (CI) measures the load on central teams
- Ratio comparison highlights potential bottlenecks
- Throughput factor ensures practical capacity limits are considered

## Target-Based Planning

Our target-based planning approach reverses traditional bottom-up planning, starting with desired outcomes and working backwards to required changes.

### Model Selection

The choice between team-based and ticket-based platforms reflects two fundamental approaches to service delivery optimization:

1. **Team-Based Platform**
   ```
   Team Optimization Focus:
   
   [Team A] ←→ [Platform] ←→ [Team B]
        ↑          ↑           ↑
   Workflows   Automation   Processes
   ```

2. **Ticket-Based Platform**
   ```
   Ticket Flow Optimization:
   
   [Input] → [Queue] → [Processing] → [Output]
      ↑         ↑          ↑            ↑
   Routing   Batching   Automation   Validation
   ```

### Investment Analysis

The Maximum Allowable Investment (MAI) formulas incorporate both risk management and ROI considerations:

For Team-Based:
```math
MAI_{team} = \min(0.5 × AC_{team}, 1.5 × TS)
```



Design Rationale:
- 50% annual cost limit prevents over-investment risk
- 1.5× target savings ensures positive ROI
- Minimum function provides automatic risk adjustment

### Scenario Planning

Our scenario framework provides three standardized paths to improvement, based on extensive analysis of successful transformations:

| Scenario | Timeline | Team Reduction | Service Efficiency | Overhead Reduction |
|----------|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | 24 months | 10% | +15% | -5% |
| Moderate | 18 months | 15% | +25% | -10% |
| Aggressive | 12 months | 20% | +35% | -15% |



The percentages and timelines were calibrated based on:
- Historical transformation data
- Risk tolerance patterns
- Typical organizational change capacity
- Industry standard improvement rates

### Implementation Paths

#### Conservative Path (24 months)
- Lower risk profile
- Gradual implementation
- Minimal disruption
- Higher stability

#### Moderate Path (18 months)
- Balanced approach
- Moderate risk
- Steady improvements
- Flexible timeline

#### Aggressive Path (12 months)
- Rapid implementation
- Higher risk tolerance
- Quick results
- Significant change
