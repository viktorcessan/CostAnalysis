Looking for a skilled web developer to help enhance a React-based web application Iâ€™ve created with gpt and claude.



The app is designed for operations and tech leads aimed at helping them generate evaluate cost implications of transitioning from manual operations and service delivery to a platform-based approach.



The app compares costs between service delivery teams and platform automation, factoring in inputs like team size, hourly rates, and platform costs. It also provides detailed cost analysis, break-even points, and potential savings using data visualizations powered by Chart.js.



The app is functional but requires further development to make it more comprehensive, user-friendly, and tailored for decision-makers.



What I Need Help With:
-Expand calculations
-Add outsourcing as an alternative to platform
-Simplify flow
-Add more interactive and intuitive charts (currently built with Chart.js).
-Refine tooltips, inputs, and advanced options to ensure clarity for non-technical users



The deliverable:
A functioning web-app, either the same html file as I have now, or broken down to a css, js, and html file. It will be hosted on one.com so it needs to be something simple.



I'm looking for someone to not only do the coding, but also to bounce the calculation logic with me.



You need to be apt at math, statistics, and business.



The app is not going to be a paid app, but a free app. It's meant to be very light weight and show more of a investment vector. It ought to be vaguely right.


. For example, I know what data managers usually have access to, and what assumptions they are comfortable with making. I also know how boards make investment decisions, and I have experience from helping companies scale up and down their orgs. But I need help with determining which variables to collect and how to build the algorithms for that.
